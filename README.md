# Lau - Node.js project starter

Lau initializes your Node.js project. It creates a new directory, runs `npm init -y`, installs the dependicies, creates index.js, runs `git init`. It automatically includes your dependicies to index.js. Point being. IT SAVES YOU TIME. It is perfect for any project. Even the smallests temporary test projects benefit from version control and an intialized package.json. It also cd's to that new dir. Again, IT SAVES TIME. Use it!

Usage:

```
    ~/projects  lau my-app phin magic-string                                                    ✔
    ~/projects/my-app    main ?4  cat index.js                                              ✔
const phin = require('phin')
const magicString = require('magic-string')
```

As you can see, git has been initialized, you are in your project folder and ready to code.
